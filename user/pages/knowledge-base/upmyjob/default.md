## Project Outline

This project is all about learning all the things on your own that you will not learn on the job.
- move your resume forward by not being limited to what your company uses
- stay focused on the **right** way instead of when your company gets off track
- avoid becoming entrenched in your company's proprietary way of doing things. again moving the resume forward.

And finally, pave the way to stop working for other people and move your retirement goals into REALITY. Before it is too late to matter.

We are much more motivated when we are doing for ourselves. True buy-in occurs when you understand the philosophy because YOU wrote it.

Fixing other people's shortsighted, hurried, wreckless creations is frustrating every step of the way. Spending your time in someone else's nightmare is NO way to grow. 

Code and design are highly opinionated, and being there as an architect is the only way to drive the finished product toward maintainability and durability.

## Project Roadmap

With the use of open source tooling wherever possible, the goals are:
- estabish aws-cli on all nodes used.
