## Project Outline

This project is all about executing subprojects for learning all the things on your own that you will not learn on the job.
- move your resume forward by not being limited to what your company uses
- stay focused on the **right** way instead of when your company gets off track
- avoid becoming entrenched in your company's proprietary way of doing things. again moving the resume forward.

And finally, pave the way to stop working for other people and move your retirement goals into REALITY. Before it is too late to matter.

We are much more motivated when we are doing for ourselves. True buy-in occurs when you understand the philosophy because YOU wrote it.

Fixing other people's shortsighted, hurried, wreckless creations is frustrating every step of the way. Spending your time in someone else's nightmare is NO way to grow. 

Code and design are highly opinionated, and being there as an architect is the only way to drive the finished product toward maintainability and durability.

## The AWS Microservices Subproject

### Roadmap

With the use of open source tooling wherever possible, the goal here is an AWS hosted platform to build and host microservice based containers on AWS, first on ECS and then on to EKS Kubernetes.

All infrastructure will sit on the upmyjob.com domain, which is currently pointing to AWS Route 53.

**Steps:**

1. Source the documentation needed for the technologies:
- docker
- kubernetes
- AWS
- Terraform
- Packer
- Ansible
- Jenkins
- bash
- Python

2. Establish GitHub private repos for the code.

3. Configure the AWS CLI on workstation.

4. Decide what containers to run and either pull or create.

5. Create custom AMIs with Packer to run on EC2 instances for ECS.
